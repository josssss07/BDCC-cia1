## Objective: Perform a comparitive study of python performance and with parallelization 

## Overview and details 

This study aims to analyse the speed and performance of various types of python, along with the use of multithreading and parallelization to improve effciency in real world scenario. 
The variants of python used in particular are: 
- CPython (regular python)
- Cyhton (an implementation of python that uses the C compiler)
- Pypy (an implementation of python that uses a just in time compiler)
- Jython (an implementation that converts python to java to use the java compiler)

---- 

## Main sections: 

### Part 1: Performance analysis: 

This section focuses on the various implementations of python and how thir compiler has an effect on the effiency of the code
The variants of python used are Cpython, Cyhton, Pypy and Jython. All the test code required can be found in the py_code folder. 
The variants need to be installed by their own various methods of installation. 
This is to show how programs can have an increased amount of effiency for their execution and have real world benifits. 
To demonstate this, a recurive fibonacci function was used

### Part 2: Parallelization: 

This section focused on how the use of mulithreading and profiling of code can help with an improved execution time. This also allowed us to look into the BigO notation and does it hold constant if a program has multithreading involved. 
Various mini scripts were used to demo this that can be found in their respective folders along with screenshots of their execution

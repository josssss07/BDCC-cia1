## Objective: Perform a comparitive study of python performance and with parallelization 

## Overview and details 

This study aims to analyse the speed and performance of various types of python, in particular: 
- CPython (regular python)
- Cyhton (an implementation of python that uses the C compiler)
- Pypy (an implementation of python that uses a just in time compiler)
- Jython (an implementation that converts python to java to use the java compiler)

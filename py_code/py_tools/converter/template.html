<h2>Section 1: Performance:</h2>
<p>In this section we will look at the performance and speed of execution of various variants of python 
For this test, all variants had to execute a script that would solve the fibonacci series through a set number of iterations. 
The test was timed with the use of the timeit library and each variant executed the test 3 times to get a gague of the results. </p>

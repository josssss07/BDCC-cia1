## Project overview:

The study aims to evaluate the performance between the various implementation of python.
In particular it looks at : 
- CPython (the standard implementation of python)
- Cython (an implementaion which convernts python into C code)
- Pypy (an implementation of python with a just in time complier)
<!-- #TODO: ADD ONE MORE PYTHON IMEPLEMENTATION LATER -->

## Part 1: Performance comparison of the various python imeplementations: 

To test the performance of the various flavors of python, I picked the fibonacci series

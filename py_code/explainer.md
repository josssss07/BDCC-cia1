Tasks and Guidelines

 

1. Performance Comparison of Python Implementations

Explore and compare the performance of Python implementations (e.g., CPython, PyPy, Jython).
Install the respective Python flavors and test them using diverse benchmarking programs.
Deliverables:

Chart Comparison: Create a chart illustrating the performance differences for a specific dataset or algorithm across Python implementations.
Outputs: Include screenshots of the outputs generated by the benchmarking tests.
 

2. Algorithm Parallelization

Select an algorithm and parallelize its execution using threading or multiprocessing.
Measure and demonstrate the improvement (if any) in execution time.
Deliverables:

Use a profiling tool, such as Python's cProfile, to analyze the algorithm before and after parallelization.
Scalability Analysis: Evaluate the scalability of the algorithm in terms of Big O notation and its efficiency when parallelized. Present findings in a structured format.

            <h2>Project overview:</h2>
            <p>The study aims to evaluate the performance between the various implementation of python.
            Along with a performance analysis, we also look into how using parallel processing can have an effect on the performance and I/O operations. Lastly looking at how the parallel processing affects the BigO notation. </p>
            <p>For the performance section of the program we take a look at: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> CPython (the standard implementation of python)</li>
                <li> Cython (an implementaion which convernts python into C code)</li>
                <li> Pypy (an implementation of python with a just in time complier)</li>
                <li> Jython (an impelmentation of python that runs with the java compiler and garbage collector)</li>

        <h2>Section 1: Performance:</h2>
        <p>In this section we will look at the performance and speed of execution of various variants of python 
        For this test, all variants had to execute a script that would solve the fibonacci series through a set number of iterations. 
        The test was timed with the use of the timeit library and each variant executed the test 3 times to get a gague of the results. </p>
        <p>Below are the performance for the tests run for CPython:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>The standard implementaion of Python (Cpython) has the slowest performance compared to the variants of python</li>
            <li>The fastest variant was Cython, with Pypy in second and Jython in third</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b> <ul> Overall we can see the following:</ul></b> </p>
        <p>CPython is the default and most widely-used implementation of Python. It's written in C and focuses on compatibility and ease of use rather than speed.</p>
        <p>Cython allows Python code to be compiled into C, making it faster by converting Python code into highly efficient C code.
            This is particularly useful for computationally intensive tasks like mathematical operations or data processing.</p>
        <p>
            PyPy is an alternative implementation of Python with a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler that optimizes the execution of code during runtime.
            It is generally faster than CPython for long-running programs because it compiles frequently used parts of code into machine language.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jython is a Python implementation that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It allows Python code to interoperate with Java code but isn't as fast as Cython or PyPy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Python's performance varies greatly depending on the implementation.
            If speed is critical, alternatives like Cython or PyPy should be considered instead of CPython.
            Each implementation has trade-offs, such as compatibility, ease of use, and integration with other systems.

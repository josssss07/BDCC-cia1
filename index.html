            <h2>Project overview:</h2>
            <p>The study aims to evaluate the performance between the various implementation of python.
            Along with a performance analysis, we also look into how using parallel processing can have an effect on the performance and I/O operations. Lastly looking at how the parallel processing affects the BigO notation. </p>
            <p>For the performance section of the program we take a look at: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> CPython (the standard implementation of python)</li>
                <li> Cython (an implementaion which convernts python into C code)</li>
                <li> Pypy (an implementation of python with a just in time complier)</li>
                <li> Jython (an impelmentation of python that runs with the java compiler and garbage collector)</li>
            </ul>

    <h2>Section 1: Performance:</h2>
    <p>In this section we will look at the performance and speed of execution of various variants of python 
    For this test, all variants had to execute a script that would solve the fibonacci series through a set number of iterations. 
    The test was timed with the use of the timeit library and each variant executed the test 3 times to get a gague of the results. </p>

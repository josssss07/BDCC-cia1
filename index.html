    <h2 id="overview-and-details">Overview and details</h2>
    <p>This study aims to evaluate the performance of various Python implementations (e.g., CPython, PyPy, Jython) by measuring processing speed and analyzing the impact of parallelization on algorithm execution. The tasks are divided into two main objectives: comparing Python implementations and investigating the effects of parallelization.</p>
    <h3 id="languages-used-for-benchmarking-">Languages used for benchmarking:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>CPython (standard implementation) </li>
    <li>JPython (python implemented in java)</li>
    <li>PyPy (Alternative python that uses a Just-In-Time compiler)</li>
    <li>Cython (converts python like code to C)</li>
    </ul>
